## Objectives

At the end of this lecture, you will be able to

- derive non-linear classifiers from feature maps

- move from coordinate parameterization to weighting examples

- compute kernel functions induced from feature maps

- use kernel perceptron, kernel linear regression

- understand the properties of kernel functions

## Outline

- Non-linear classification and regression
- Feature maps, their inner products
- Kernel functions induced from feature maps
- Kernel methods, kernel perceptron
- Other non-linear classifiers (e.g. Random Forest)

## Introduction to Non-linear Classification

Kernel method: operating on high dimensional vector without explicitly having to construct them.
