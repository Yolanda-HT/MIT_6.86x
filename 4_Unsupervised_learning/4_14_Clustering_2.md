## Objectives

- Understand the limitations of the K-Means algorithm
- Understand how K-Medoids algorithm is different from the K-Means algorithm
- Understand the computational complexity of the K-Means and the K-Medoids algorithms
- Understand the importance of choosing the right number of clusters
- Understand elements that can be supervised in unsupervised learning

## Limitations of the K Means Algorithm
- Representative is not one of the original points (might not be useful for cases such as news recommendation)
- Only works when cost function is squared euclidean distance

*In unsupervised clustering: indirect supervision can be used to improve performance (e.g. bag of words approach - provide weigh to words based on importance)*
