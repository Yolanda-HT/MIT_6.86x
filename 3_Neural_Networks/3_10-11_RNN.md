## 10. Introduction to recurrent neural networks (RNNs)

At the end of this lecture, you will be able to

- Know the difference between feed-forward and recurrent neural networks(RNNs).
- Understand the role of gating and memory cells in long-short term memory (LSTM).
- Understand the process of encoding of RNNs in modeling sequences.


## Difference between RNN and FNN
1. In RNN, input is fed into each layer, as well as from layer before
2. Number of layers in neural networ changes base on the sequence
3. Same parameter is applied to each layer
