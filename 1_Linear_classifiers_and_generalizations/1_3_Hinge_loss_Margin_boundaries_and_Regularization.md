## Objectives

At the end of this lecture, you will be able to

- understand the need for maximizing the margin

- pose linear classification as an optimization problem

- understand hinge loss, margin boundaries and regularization


### Margin Boundary

The decision boundary is the set of points  𝑥  which satisfy
𝜃⋅𝑥+𝜃0=0. 
 
The Margin Boundary is the set of points  𝑥  which satisfy
𝜃⋅𝑥+𝜃0=±1. 
 
So, the distance from the decision boundary to the margin boundary is  1∣∣𝜃∣∣ .


### Hinge Loss and Objective Function
