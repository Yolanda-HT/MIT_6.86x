# 5. Grading policy

Your overall score in this class will be a weighted average of your scores for the different components, with the following weights:

- 16% for the lecture exercises (divided equally among the 16 out of 19 lectures)
- 1% for the Homework 0
- 12% for the homeworks (divided equally among 4 (out of 5) homeworks)
- 2% for the Project 0
- 36% for the Projects (divided equally among 4 (out of 5)
- 13% for the Midterm exam (timed)
- 20% for the final exam (timed)

To earn a verified certificate for this course, you will need to obtain an overall score of 60% or more of the maximum possible overall score.

Lecture Exercises, Problem Sets, and Projects

- The lowest 3 scores among the 19 lectures will be dropped, so only 16 out of 19 lectures will count .

- The lowest 1 scores among the 5 homeworks (excluding homework 0) will be dropped, so only 4 out of 5 homeworks will count .

- The lowest 1 score among the 5 projects (excluding project 0) will be dropped, so only 4 out of 5 projects will count .

This policy is to accommodate for scheduling conflict, illness, or events which might deter you from completing the work before the deadline with the best grades you can. However, we still fully expect you to learn the material for any dropped assignments, and the exams will cover everything.

Note that not every homework, set of lecture exercises, project will have the same number of raw points. For example, homework 0 may have 53 points and homework 1 may have 43 points. However, each homework receives the same weight for the purpose of calculating your overall score. Similar for lecture exercises and projects.

Under the â€œProgress" tab at the top, you can see your score broken down for each assignment, as well as a summary plot.

Timed Exams

The midterm exam and final exam are timed exams . This means that each exam is available for approximately a week, but once you open the exam, there is a limited amount of time (48 hours), counting from when you start, within which you must complete the exam. Please plan in advance for the exams. If you do not complete the whole exam during the allowed time, you will miss the points associated with the questions that have not been answered. The exams are designed to assess your knowledge. There are no extensions granted to these deadlines. You can find the exam dates on the calendar on the previous page.

Warning: Note that the timed exams CANNOT be completed using the edX mobile app.

Exam Access: Note that the midterm and final exams will not be available to audit learners. These exams are assessment for learners interested in the course certificates.
