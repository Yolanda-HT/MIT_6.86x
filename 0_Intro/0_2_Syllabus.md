# 4. Syllabus

Due dates of lectures exercises, homeworks and projects are on Tuesday . Due dates of the midterm and final exams are on Mondays .

The release date of each unit is roughly 2 weeks before the due date.

Time Commitment :

The corresponding on-campus class is designed so that MIT students with appropriate prerequisites in mathematics spend on average 12 hours per week on lectures, homework, and coding exercises. You should expect a comparable effort, or more if you need to catch up on background material.

In a typical week, there will be roughly 2 hours of lecture clips, but it might take you 3.5 hours when you add the time spent on exercises. Finally, expect about 4-6 hours spent on the homeworks, and 5-14 hours on the biweekly projects.
