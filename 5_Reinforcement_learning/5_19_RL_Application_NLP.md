## Objectives

- Understand key problems/research areas in Natural Language Processing field
- Understand challenges in various NLP tasks
- Understand differences between symbolic and statistical Approaches to NLP
- Understand neural network based learnt feature representations for text encoding


## Language Technology
- Mostly solved:
	- Spam detection
	- Part-of-speech (POS) tagging
	- Named entity recognition (NER)
- Making good progress
	- Sentiment analysis
	- Coreference resolution
	- Word sense disambiguation (WSD)
	- Parsing
	- Machine translation (MT)
	- Information extraction (IE)
- Still really hard
	- Question answering (QA)
	- Paraphrase
	- Summarization
	- Dialog

## Knowledge Bottleneck in NLP
- We need:
	- Knowledge about language
	- Knowledge about the world

- Possible solutions:
	- Symbolic approach: encode all required information into computer
	- Statistical approach: infer language properties from language samples
